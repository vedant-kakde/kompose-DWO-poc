# Compose File Support for Devworkspace Operator POC

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This repository is a proof of concept for integrating the compose file support in the devworkspace operator repostiory by resuing the pkgs of kubernetes kompose.

- Currently, the POC only works with compose files which contain deployments and services.
- kompose doesn't provide support for compose files with the build command.
- kubeconfig file needs to be set specifically for Openshift, unlike minikube.

## Work in progress

- Addition of unit testing for testing different compose files.
- Allowing testing on different clusters.
- Addition of support for different kubernetes components like volumes and RBACs for advanced compose file
